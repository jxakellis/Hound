// TO DO BUG PRIO: LOW reminders and logs disappearing. Happens primarily when involved with other users / when sourced from other users. Typically disppears with lifecycle, e.g. goes to background then opens later and its missing.
// For example: the new log/reminder is synced to the device, so the server won't return it anymore. Then it appears the new log/reminder isn't persisted so when the user opens the app again, the new log/reminder is missing. The issue can be solved by hitting Redownload Data
