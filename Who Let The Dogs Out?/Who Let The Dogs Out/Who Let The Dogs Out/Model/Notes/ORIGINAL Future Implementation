ORIGINAL Future Implementation Needed

2/23/2021

**    Add logging record feature?

Home Page
    Change alarms to reminders (and change home in tabbar to reminders)
    Add display to show when timer was last executed, do not integrate pause with it as it should show how long from it was last executed
    Add three different options for when the alarm goes off, turn off (change isEnabled), one for remind shortly/ snooze (e.g. 30 minutes) and one for reset alarm (already implemented)
    Decrease precision when converting time to string, if over an hour show hours and minutes, if under an hour show minutes no seconds, and only show seconds under a minute
    
Dogs
    Change from dogs overview to dogs configeration
    Add editting for a requirement
    Add nudge/error if trying to add a dog with no requirements
    
    AddDog
        Add title to the top like the tab bar pages, e.g. Create Dog
        Hide big green and back when adding a requirement/need to a dog, how dad fumbled when not clicking addToList before hitting big green to update/add dog.
        Change from needs to reminders in all parts
        Change embedded Add need thing from Add A Need to Create reminder
        When adding a need/reminder change back arrow from <Needs to just <
        Change from Add To List to Add (tab bar button)

AlertController
    Create different Utils for willShowDogReminder (? on name) instead of willShowAlert as wSDR will have three button but wSA will only have the ok button
