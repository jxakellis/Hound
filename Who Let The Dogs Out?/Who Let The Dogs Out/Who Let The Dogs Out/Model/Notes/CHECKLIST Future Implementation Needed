CHECKLIST Future Implementation Needed

Create default schedule that is based off researched numbers for users when they first launch the app, basically just modify the default dog a tiny bit so it has accurate real life numbers.

Time of day
    Add checkbox when time of day is selected when creating/updating reminder where user can select a certain time interval to be reminded after the task is completed (NOT SNOOZED). Potentially call it (when showing alarm) Post-Task Reminder and say at the bottom when configuring the requirement "Remind me again (DATE PICKER) after this reminder"
    TECH INFO:
        Compartmentalize requirements so it has two different classes inside, one thats countdown components which has all of the current things and then add TimeOfDay components that can store time of day. Right now only one time of day reminder is needed but DO NOT build functionality for multiple time of day reminders within one requirement as it will add to much completity. Potentially add later but dad said not to.

Change add button to an animated button. Make little pop ups for different options. Example: If you have three dogs, make pop ups above blue add button (bottom to top in this order) Add A Dog, Add A reminder for Penny, Add a reminder for Fido, Add a reminder for Penny, and Add a reminder for Ginger
