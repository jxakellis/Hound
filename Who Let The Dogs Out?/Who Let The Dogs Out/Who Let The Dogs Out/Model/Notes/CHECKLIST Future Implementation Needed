CHECKLIST Future Implementation Needed

Change cancel button when you have a .alert alertController when a reminder goes off to make the reminder enabled but inactive, i.e. say no more time left and leave it to sit there until handled e.g. clicking Did it!

Sound when alert pops up in app (vibration?)

Font awesome?

Icon for app (explore art teacher)

App name exploration, link into words in the work of puppy training and house breaking. Explore amazon for example.

Write app store description, should be used in app story obviously but also given to usability testers (in additon to what they should try to do)

Work on logs page
