Future Implementation Needed


All Pages
Have text at top to tell what page it is, e.g. at top of home page say home (or maybe active alarms?)

Dog Model
Remove dog breed
Possible remove dog description

Dogs Page
remove weird up arrows to denote sublist, make dog name a tad bigger instead and it should be good

Home + Dogs Page
Add blue circle dog/plus button to the bottom right, makes it much clearer



Bugs

Fix bug where when an error is produced from adding a dog, the alert of that error does not dismiss the view, right now if you produce an error e.g. like a second "Fido" AlertForError or whatever will display the error but before is presents the error is dismisses any currently presented view to show itself, find out how to stack ontop?

When adding a dog and editting a text field, e.g. the name or description, if you click elsewhere to do something else, it does not dismiss the keyboard that pops up, make it so if somewhere else if clicked is resigns the first responder. Note, this is also a bug inside the embedded requirement/need adding view, so address there too.
