Future Implementation Needed

DogRequirementManager
    extension DogRequirementProtocol
        mutating func resetLabel()
            Goes hand in hand with future error about two dogs being set to same name of "", build system
            
DogSpecificationManager
    extension DogSpecificationManagerProtocol
        func checkDogSpecificationValueValid(key: String?, value: String?) -> Bool
            Build system to check if a value is valid, e.g. if the key is "name" check if the value provided for name is valid, if its "description" check if the description is valid. Build a flexible system to adapt to changing keys, possibly implement constants for the keys too so they are constant and known.
