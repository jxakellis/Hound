If calculating the execution date and it is concincidentally equal to the current time, this buffer could possibly account for computing time, so that when the date returned is finally used instead of being 1 second old and thrown away it is about to happen and used. I have no clue if this is necessary but I have added it temporarily while I figure out if it is
