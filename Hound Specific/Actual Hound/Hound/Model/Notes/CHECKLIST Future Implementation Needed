CHECKLIST Future Implementation Needed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OLD CHECKLIST, JUNIOR YEAR

In progress:

Needed:
LogsViewController .catagorizedLogTypes efficency by reducing calls to it

Wants:
Thinks logs alignment could be better so can easily scan through

Consider:
No prompt to add notes when logging something, can only do at a later point in time

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENT CHECKLIST, SENIOR YEAR

MAIN



DATABASE

Current Idea: Global Endpoint Lock
    If the app is in a state where it is updating something, it cannot send those updates to the server. Those update can only be pushed once the user is done editting and decides to SAVE (not cancel). E.g. If editting a dog and you modify a reminder, this might trigger an endpoint embedded in the reminder. This endpoint will then go nowhere because of the global lock (without it then the update would be pushed to the server). If the users decides to SAVE the dog, it will then disable the global lock and push changes to the server. If the user cancels then everything is discarded and the server never even knew this happened.
