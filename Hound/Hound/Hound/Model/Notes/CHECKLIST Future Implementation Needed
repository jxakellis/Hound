CHECKLIST Future Implementation Needed

Dad Review:
-"Yes, I dont want to save changes" wording in auto save confirmation, find screen shot of competitor

In progress:

Needed:
Configurable log types
LogsViewController .catagorizedLogTypes efficency by reducing calls to it
schedule one time reminder

Wants:
Thinks logs alignment could be better so can easily scan through
Add confirmation for deleting dog/reminder from reminders page
No filter indication of active filtering

Consider:
maybe change feed to be breakfast lunch and dinner
Some pages have save while some don't (logs & reminder vs settings)
No option for doctor visit
No prompt to add notes when logging something, can only do at a later point in time
