CHECKLIST Future Implementation Needed

**Thinks the info pages could be more interactive. Instead of describing, show with pictures.

Want medicine default
Wasn't clear exactly how to add reminder to a dog, clicked on a dog and saw action sheet and toom a second, finally figured out add button in bottom right
Filter spot not clear at first, took second to find
Likes filter ability
Reminders page/configure dogs page is straight forward
12:15 PM alarms visual display shows as 12:15 Am even though set correctly as PM time
Snooze default of 30 minutes is too long, set default to less.
Default snooze time would depend, take the dog out would be short (<5 mins) but other things can be longer like feedings (~10 - ~30 mins), Dad thinks its feature creep to make snoozes different depending on scheduled log type.
Configurable log types
Thinks follow up notification is a reminder after when the reminder is snoozed
Thinks app could be useful for a full grown dog with the multi user enviroment (pat and melissa have trouble corrodinating who fed the dog, don't really need reminders but needs tracking).
Wants dismiss button to restart the timing but not log even, same as clicking "Log ..." but without the recording feature.
Unclearing filter is not clear
Dad say put picture of dog next to log on log page
When clicking on a dog, should have option for add dog.
