CHECKLIST Future Implementation Needed

***Add more info for follow up delay on settings, doesn't know the difference between snooze and follow up.

**Don't save reminder doesn't check if info has changed, always pops

***Be able to add picture of dog, add breed info with attached stuff real life info.

**Logs page is just a history log, can't add info (you can through notes but that isn't clear). Make notes more clear.

*Sorting of reminders page instead of chronological, sort like dogs page.

***Logos / icons for reminders (maybe dog)

Instead of actionSheet pop up on reminders page, would rather have another page to add info

Want different page when clicking on a note, segue to a different page instead. Show info and ability to edit.

***Left to a different tab bar page before hitting save, maybe auto save if the person leaves the page.

**Thinks the info pages are the exact same between pages, not different / custom info. Also are a bit lengthy. Could be more interactive. Instead of describing, show with pictures.

Thinks the recurring timer keeps repeating even if not responded to.

Auto sort requirements for a dog chronologically.

Change dogs to configure and configure dogs to configure reminders, display time left (like on reminders page) under the requirement

Change entering name of reminder to drop down of types
